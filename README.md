# Paraphrasing Evaluation
This survey makes it possible to rate softer and very soft versions of articles on their factuality and language intensity.

Features include
* getting a different set of three articles depending on the count of survey answers (except for "Tote bei israelischen Angriffen in Gaza")
* automatically saving the answers to the local storage so users can take a break during the survey
* randomizing the article
* progress bar
